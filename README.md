# Ekman transport as the driver of extreme interannual formation rates of Eighteen Degree Water

## Abstract
In the North Atlantic subtropical gyre, the Eighteen Degree Water (EDW) is a voluminous heat reservoir, submerged under a seasonal pycnocline that can be progressively removed through the winter, allowing an EDW ventilation in the early spring. We target the EDW formation extremes, namely 2004-2005, 2009-2010, and 2012-2013 for the strong years, and 2007-2008, 2008-2009, 2011-2012, and 2013-2014 for the weak years. We employ gridded hydrographic datasets mainly measured by Argo floats over the last 20 years, and provide a synthetic study on the extreme events of strong and weak EDW formation of this time period. We found that the Ekman transport is the indicator and driving mechanism explaining these extremes. Strong (Weak) EDW formation years correspond with atmospheric patterns resembling NAO- (NAO+), attributed to a strong(weak) winter air-sea surface heat loss, and a strong (weak) winter heat loss due to Ekman transport. Further, we show that such extreme Ekman advection patterns can belinked to mid-latitude storms, of which both intensity and duration have an impact onthe extreme of EDW ventilation in the western subtropical North Atlantic. To yield a strong EDW formation, it requires a large winter heat deficit due to Ekman transport, which can be sufficiently represented by numbers of strong winter storms, most notably,remnants of hurricanes and US east coast snowstorms. Meanwhile, to yield a weak EDW formation, apart from weak atmospheric forcings, a remnant heat content anomaly carried through from previous years would serve as an unfavorable preconditioning, hindering the EDW formation.

## Background
## The Gulf Stream system
The North Atlantic Subtropical Gyre is the largest heat reservoir on Earth
This region experienced warming since 1970s. This schematic shows the Gulf stream system:

The subtropical gyre drives the Gulf Stream. The eighteen degree mode water is situated In the mid of the subtropical gyre. We aim to investigate the heat content of this region, to understand how EDW contributes to the subtropical gyre from the heat content point of view.


Firstly, we will introduce EDW's location, identify the EDW criteria. Then, we will review the EDW seasonal cycle and the EDW subduction. We will examine the correlation of EDW volume and EDW heat content, the correlation of EDW volume and NAO. Lastly, we will review the dynamics behind an individual EDW event, in terms of the roles that play air-sea heat loss, preconditioning. ![Click here for details](https://github.com/keli559/Ekman-transport-a-trigger-of-interannual-extreme-formation-rates-of-Eighteen-Degree-Water/tree/main/background#whats-eighteen-degree-water-edw)

## To be addressed:
##### 1. With Argo observational datasets, we aim to investigate the North Atlantic basin subsurface signatures of extreme winters
##### 2. Given better quality of datasets since 2000s, we aim to understand the drivers of EDW extreme years, through the following factors:
#######      a. Air-sea heat fluxes
#######      b. Ekman current
#######      c. Preconditioning
