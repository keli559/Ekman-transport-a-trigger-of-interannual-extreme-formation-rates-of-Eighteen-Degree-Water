# Ekman transport as the driver of extreme interannual formation rates of Eighteen Degree Water

## Abstract
In the North Atlantic subtropical gyre, the Eighteen Degree Water (EDW) is a voluminous heat reservoir, submerged under a seasonal pycnocline that can be progressively removed through the winter, allowing an EDW ventilation in the early spring. We target the EDW formation extremes, namely 2004-2005, 2009-2010, and 2012-2013 for the strong years, and 2007-2008, 2008-2009, 2011-2012, and 2013-2014 for the weak years. We employ gridded hydrographic datasets mainly measured by Argo floats over the last 20 years, and provide a synthetic study on the extreme events of strong and weak EDW formation of this time period. We found that the Ekman transport is the indicator and driving mechanism explaining these extremes. Strong (Weak) EDW formation years correspond with atmospheric patterns resembling NAO- (NAO+), attributed to a strong(weak) winter air-sea surface heat loss, and a strong (weak) winter heat loss due to Ekman transport. Further, we show that such extreme Ekman advection patterns can belinked to mid-latitude storms, of which both intensity and duration have an impact onthe extreme of EDW ventilation in the western subtropical North Atlantic. To yield a strong EDW formation, it requires a large winter heat deficit due to Ekman transport, which can be sufficiently represented by numbers of strong winter storms, most notably,remnants of hurricanes and US east coast snowstorms. Meanwhile, to yield a weak EDW formation, apart from weak atmospheric forcings, a remnant heat content anomaly carried through from previous years would serve as an unfavorable preconditioning, hindering the EDW formation.

## Background
## The Gulf Stream system
The North Atlantic Subtropical Gyre is the largest heat reservoir on Earth.
This region experienced warming since 1970s. This schematic shows the Gulf stream system:

<sub>The branches indicate the currents. <strong>Branch A</strong>  is the North Atlantic Current, <strong>Branch B</strong> indicates the eastward traveling subtropical branch. <strong>Branch C</strong> indicates the southern branch of the subtropical recirculation gyre. And <strong>Branch D</strong> indicates the northern cyclonic recirculation gyre. 
The blue colored contours in depth indicate the deepest mixed layer depth.</sub>

The subtropical gyre drives the Gulf Stream. EDW is situated in the mid of the subtropical gyre. We aim to investigate the heat content of this region, to understand how EDW contributes to the subtropical gyre from the heat content point of view.


Firstly, we will introduce EDW's location, identify the EDW criteria. Then, we will review the EDW seasonal cycle and the EDW subduction. We will examine the correlation of EDW volume and EDW heat content, the correlation of EDW volume and NAO. Lastly, we will review the dynamics behind an individual EDW event, in terms of the roles that play air-sea heat loss, preconditioning. ![Click here for details](https://github.com/keli559/Ekman-transport-a-trigger-of-interannual-extreme-formation-rates-of-Eighteen-Degree-Water/tree/main/background#whats-eighteen-degree-water-edw)

## To be addressed:
##### 1. With Argo observational datasets, we aim to investigate the North Atlantic basin subsurface signatures of extreme winters
##### 2. Given better quality of datasets since 2000s, we aim to understand the drivers of EDW extreme years, through the following factors:
* Air-sea heat fluxes
* Ekman current
* Preconditioning

## Methodology
![subtropical gyre and EDW](https://github.com/keli559/Ekman-transport-a-trigger-of-interannual-extreme-formation-rates-of-Eighteen-Degree-Water/blob/main/slide_15_ke_li.png)

We estimated the heat budget in our domain of analysis. In this figure, the <strong>grey contours</strong> indicate the SSH. Especially, the <strong>thick green solid contour</strong> is the SSH of 0.39m, indicating the mean Gulf Stream position. On <strong>purple</strong> is the deepest mixed layer depth in meters.

We start by the temperature equation: the temperature change of a water mass is the function of the external forcings. We integrated this equation over the domain of analysis, and then we multiplied with reference density and the sea-water heat capacity. This gives us:
* the heat content change of a fixed water column, with a depth of 800 meters, is a function of 
* the air-sea heat loss,
* the heat convergence due to geostrophic advection,
* the heat convergence due to EKman advection, and the mixing 

How do we define the EDW extremes?

### Interannual Variability
* The variability within 6-50 month window
### EDW Extremes
* Outliers that exceed ![equation](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\pm1\sigma)
of the interannual variability of EDW freshly ventilated volume
* Note the non-Gaussian distribution of the total sampling

The diagram below shows the EDW ventilated volume in Svys. <strong>Black dots</strong> indicate the seasonal volume maxima in March.
We rid that time series of the seasonal cycle, then we applied a 6-50 month band pass filter to obtain the interannual time series located below. We selected as extremes the outliers that exceed plus or minus standard deviation of the interannual time series. 

With all that, letâ€™s take a look at the direct results. 
## Direct Results

<sub>Figure 4-1 1950-2020 interannual variability of EDW outcropping volume and its extreme occurrences.
(<strong>Upper</strong>) The interannual variability of seasonal-maximum EDW outcropping volume is in the solid blue line with dots.
(<strong>Lower</strong>) The orignal time series of the EDW outcropping volume is in solid black line with dots.
We used the EN4, ISAS, Scripps, and IPRC datasets to produce the time series.

We used 4 datasets to realise this plot: EN4, ISAS, SCRIPPS and IPRC. they are 
the observation-based, gridded datasets. 
Note that it is not until  2002 that we have the four datasets all available. 
Before 2002, we only had EN4. (![Click to see in detail the datasets](https://github.com/keli559/Ekman-transport-a-trigger-of-interannual-extreme-formation-rates-of-Eighteen-Degree-Water/tree/main/1.download_datasets#ocean-datasets-temperature-and-salinity))

Two points to cover here: First, from this time series, we found that the EDW ventilated volume reaches 
its maximum in march. Second, the extreme occurrences take place every 3 years.

With all that information, we now take a more focused look at the 2002-20 EDW freshly ventilated volume.

## 2002-2020 EDW ventilated volume
![subtropical gyre and EDW](https://github.com/keli559/Ekman-transport-a-trigger-of-interannual-extreme-formation-rates-of-Eighteen-Degree-Water/blob/main/slide_19_ke_li.png)

Here we zoom in from the previous plot, we selected as extremes the outliers that surpass the plus and minus standard deviation. 
Considering its non-gaussian distribution,  we as well counted as the extremes the local maxima and minima.
We put them in parenthesis. We found the following as the extreme occurrences:
For the strong years, we have 2005, 2010, and 2013, for the weak years, we have 2008, 2009, 2012, and 2014.

With these EDW extreme years in mind, I made a little animation of the EDW activity in the period of 2009 to 2013.
It is an example to show how EDW evolves over time.
