# Ekman transport as the driver of extreme interannual formation rates of Eighteen Degree Water

The North Atlantic Subtropical Gyre is the largest heat reservoir on Earth
This region experienced warming since 1970s. This schematic shows the Gulf stream system:

The branches indicate the currents. Branch A  is the North Atlantic Current, Branch B indicates the eastward traveling subtropical branch.
Branch C indicates the southern branch of the subtropical recirculation gyre. 
And Branch D indicates the northern cyclonic recirculation gyre. 
The blue colored contours in depth indicate the deepest mixed layer depth.


The subtropical gyre drives the Gulf Stream. 
The eighteen degree mode water  is situated In the mid of the subtropical gyre.
We aim to investigate the heat content of this region,
To understand how EDW contributes to the subtropical gyre
 from the heat content point of view.

First of all, what is EDW?
