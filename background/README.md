# Background
## The Gulf Stream system
The North Atlantic Subtropical Gyre is the largest heat reservoir on Earth
This region experienced warming since 1970s. This schematic shows the Gulf stream system:

<sub>The branches indicate the currents. <strong>Branch A</strong>  is the North Atlantic Current, <strong>Branch B</strong> indicates the eastward traveling subtropical branch. <strong>Branch C</strong> indicates the southern branch of the subtropical recirculation gyre.

The subtropical gyre drives the Gulf Stream. 
The eighteen degree mode water  is situated In the mid of the subtropical gyre.
We aim to investigate the heat content of this region,
To understand how EDW contributes to the subtropical gyre
 from the heat content point of view.

First of all, what is EDW?

## What’s Eighteen Degree Water (EDW)?
![subtropical gyre and EDW](https://github.com/keli559/Ekman-transport-a-trigger-of-interannual-extreme-formation-rates-of-Eighteen-Degree-Water/blob/main/background/slide_5_ke_li.png)

<strong>Figure (b)</strong> shows the spatial distribution of EDW in the north Atlantic. <strong>Shaded in blue</strong> is the EDW thickness in meters. <strong>The Grey contours</strong> indicate the SSH. Especially, <strong>the thick grey contour</strong> indicates the SSH of 0.39 meters, marking the mean position of the Gulf Stream. The EDW bulk is situated south of the Gulf Stream. EDW at the core has an averaged thickness around 300-400 meters. <strong>The blue solid contours</strong> give the 17 and 19 celsius degree isotherms. <strong>The dashed contour</strong> in the middle gives the 18 celsius degree isotherm. They are the SSTs of the deepest mixed layer in the early spring. In between the isotherms is the largest possible EDW surface outcropping area, calculated from 2002 to 2020. The outcropping area is where the EDW ventilation takes place. I want to point out that the outcropping region is much less than The EDW distribution.

We chose a point to look at the vertical profile of EDW. Figure (a) shows its temperature profile in August. It is a typical summertime EDW profile. The vertical axis indicates depth in meters. The horizontal axis indicates temperature in celsius degrees. Shaded in gray is the EDW, poorly stratified. In summer, The EDW is stuck between the seasonal pycnocline above and the permanent pycnocline at the bottom.

let’s take a look at the typical seasonal cycle of EDW

## EDW Ventilation: Seasonal Cycle
![subtropical gyre and EDW](https://github.com/keli559/Ekman-transport-a-trigger-of-interannual-extreme-formation-rates-of-Eighteen-Degree-Water/blob/main/background/slide_6_ke_li.png)

This figure shows the EDW seasonal cycle from a potential vorticity point of view. The water column is picked at 55W, 36N, from the map to the left. <strong>The green curves</strong> indicate the mixed layer depth. <strong>The color shades</strong> indicate the PV flux. A positive value in grey indicates a PV loss, and a negative value in red indicates a PV gain.

From September to march, the EDW water column experienced PV loss at the surface, associated with strong winter air-sea heat loss. The mixed layer deepens, reaching maximum depth in March. After April, the water column experienced PV gain at the surface, associated with weak air-sea heat loss. The bottom of the mixed layer quickly shoals.

Next, we take a look at another important process of EDW: the subduction.
## Gulf Stream system
![subtropical gyre and EDW](https://github.com/keli559/Ekman-transport-a-trigger-of-interannual-extreme-formation-rates-of-Eighteen-Degree-Water/blob/main/background/slide_7_ke_li.png)

This diagram shows the EDW bulk and its subduction through the base of the winter deepest mixed layer. The meridional cut is at 60W, right through the bulk of the EDW The zonal cut is at 30N. Located at the southern edge of the EDW bulk, near the Bermuda station.

<sub>At the two vertical domains, the <strong>color shades</strong> denote the potential vorticity. The <strong>red shades</strong> mark high PV, indicating strongly stratified water. The <strong>purple shades</strong> mark low PV, indicating nearly homogeneous water. The <strong>blue solid</strong> contours are the 17 and 19 celsius degree isotherms. The <strong>blue dashed contour</strong> in the middle is the 18 celsius degree isotherms. The <strong>grey contours</strong> indicate the SSH. The <strong>solid black curve</strong> marks the mixed layer depth. The <strong>green dashed straight lines</strong> mark our domain of analysis.</sub>

The Subduction takes place at the southern flank of the EDW bulk. It is the horizontal induction at the bottom of the mixed layer. The subducted mode water is carried by the southern branch of the recirculation gyre. Therefore, a favorable condition for a strong subduction would be: 1. The presence of a large bulk of EDW, and 2. Strong southern branch of the recirculation gyre. 

EDW is the largest heat reservoir with constant temperature in the subtropical gyre. How does EDW contribute to the subtropical gyre ocean heat content?
## Anticorrelation: EDW volume and its heat content
Research has shown that on the decadal scale, the larger EDW volume corresponds with colder EDW temperature. Since the seasonal pycnocline changes more than the permanent pycnocline, both in terms of magnitude and frequency. We have some knowledge about this relation, for example, that the EDW volume and its heat content are anticorrelated.

With that we take a look at the variability of the EDW entire volume.
## Decadal: NAO and EDW
![subtropical gyre and EDW](https://github.com/keli559/Ekman-transport-a-trigger-of-interannual-extreme-formation-rates-of-Eighteen-Degree-Water/blob/main/background/slide_9_ke_li.png)

The EDW volume varies from interannual to decadal scales. This diagram shows the time series of the EDW volume and NAO indices. <strong>Horizontal axis</strong> gives the time axis in years. <strong>Vertical axis</strong> gives the normalised values of THE EDW entire volume as well as the NAO indices. Note that it is “THE NAO indices times minus one”,  that is plotted. A positive value corresponds to a strong NAO-. On the decadal scale, research has shown that the NAO is anti-correlated with the EDW volume. This anticorrelation can also be observed on the interannual time scale at the beginning of the time series. But not towards the end. It is more complicated since mid 1980s.

Over the last 15 years, with better datasets, some specific strong or weak EDW formation events were studied. These studies explored the dynamics behind these individual EDW events. For example, the weak EDW formation in 2011 to 2012.

## Interannual: near cessation of EDW in 2011-2012

![subtropical gyre and EDW](https://github.com/keli559/Ekman-transport-a-trigger-of-interannual-extreme-formation-rates-of-Eighteen-Degree-Water/blob/main/background/slide_10_ke_li.png)

Here is a study carried out by Billheimer and Talley, about the “near cessation of EDW in 2012”. They identified preconditioning and air-sea heat fluxes as factors contributing to this weak EDW formation event. They showed that at the beginning of the ventilation season, like in september, the near-surface stratification wasn’t even that strong. They called it a favorable preconditioning, potentially for an early spring deep convection. Even with that, the 2012 weak winter air-sea heat loss was not enough to de-stratify the seasonal pycnocline, indicated in <strong>yellow shades</strong> in the diagram, near the surface. The weak wintertime forcing was the driving force behind this weak EDW event.

By the way, for the notation, in this presentation, the wintertime of a year refers to the period from September of the previous year to March of the current year.

## Preconditioning

![subtropical gyre and EDW](https://github.com/keli559/Ekman-transport-a-trigger-of-interannual-extreme-formation-rates-of-Eighteen-Degree-Water/blob/main/background/slide_11_ke_li.png)

In their study, they mentioned preconditioning. What is preconditioning? Here is a snapshot in September 2011, before the EDW formation starts. This time, I want to focus on the two side-cross-sections. The <strong>color shades</strong> indicate the potential vorticity. Shaded in <strong>dark red</strong> near the surface is the stratified water, and in <strong>light purple</strong> is the nearly homogeneous water. Thus, the preconditioning refers to the amount of heat in September, that needs to be removed, so that the near-surface stratification can be gone, and so that the EDW can ventilate to the surface in the early spring.

To form large volume of mode water, a vigorous wintertime deep convection can be facilitated by a light stratification near the surface in the precedent fall. In this case, we call the light stratification a favorable preconditioning for the mode water formation.
